# dataset characteristics
I think this idea is gorgeous and it is just allows us to directly link a whole set of variabels to human healthy status
with following ideas is pretty

if you cannot set a story in a certian grammer, then you definetely cannot solve the problem that way

# RA
This dataset originally contains two types of information.

A: phenotypes of volunteers from whom we collect samples which we refer to as metadata

B: speices profile & distance profile which we got after processing gut metagenomic reads of those samples

# Explicit demo for each as follows
291profile —— species abundance profile of 291 samples (mOTU based)
 
general Unifrac_dist.csv —— phylogenetic distance of 232 samples (phyloshift based)

RA_2015_530S_metadata_sample_fastq_phenotype —— phenotype of samples

# pject name: The oral and gut microbiomes are perturbed in rheumatoid arthritis and partly normalized after treatment

Description: RA is an autoimmune disorder affecting tens of millions of people worldwide and is associated with increased mortality owing to cardiovascular and other systemic complications. However, the etiology of RA remains elusive.

The gut microbiota is an environmental factor that influences metabolic and immune homeostasis.

We carried out metagenomic shotgun sequencing and a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) of fecal, dental and salivary samples from a cohort of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls.

Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

Usage: 
1,based on taxonomy profiles, we usually compare the compositon of microbiome between healthy and disease-related populations; whether identify discrimitive microbiome markers or ...
2, we can identify whether the microbiome composition can related to clinical measure or not.
3, to see whether we can use taconomy profiles to do classifications on healhty and disease-related population
4, could be used to stratify individuals on the basis of their response to therapy

taxonomy profiles (compositional data) 
phylogenetic profiles can be used to infer phylogenetic informations and

initial finding
The 88 MLGs that contained at least 100 genes (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4) separated RA-enriched and control-enriched MLGs along the vector for RA status in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) (Supplementary Fig. 4), confirming that they were associated mainly with RA status, rather than with other complicating factors.

what can be more 
there are still great potential of identidying different ways to utilize those 



Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.
