## Biological background 
>RA is an autoimmune disorder affecting tens of millions of people worldwide and is associated with increased mortality owing to car- diovascular and other systemic complications. However, the etiology of RA remains elusive.Microbial triggers have been implicated in RA1; however, the identity and pathogenicity of specific microbes have remained unclear.

>Although joint inflammation is characteristic of RA, inflam- mation may develop in other body sites years before the onset of joint inflammation. The gut microbiota is an environmental factor that influences metabolic and immune homeostasis.We carried out metagenomic shotgun sequencing and a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) of fecal, dental and salivary samples from a cohort of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls.
