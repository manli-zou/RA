# RA
This dataset originally contains two types of information.

A: phenotypes of volunteers from whom we collect samples which we refer to as metadata

B: speices profile & distance profile which we got after processing gut metagenomic reads of those samples

# Explicit demo for each as follows
291profile —— species abundance profile of 291 samples (mOTU based)
 
general Unifrac_dist.csv —— phylogenetic distance of 232 samples (phyloshift based)

RA_2015_530S_metadata_sample_fastq_phenotype —— phenotype of samples

# Notice
If a file contains info that you do not need, just ignore it.

Please tell me your github account if you would like to download these files so that i can allow individual permission requests.

Welcome comments and suggestions
